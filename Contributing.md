**VS Code** [Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference) _is a really great resource to get started with_


## Follow these steps
1. Fork this repo
2. Open the forked repo in your terminal and run `npm install`
3. Start to watch for changes with `npm start` - this runs a nodemon task that creates a `.vsix` file in the root directory and will automatically recompile any changes you make - it might take a while to create.
4. Open the repo in **VS Code**
5. Launch your command palette <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> and type **VSIX**. Select the one that says **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**
6. Load the **VSIX** file you created a few steps back
7. Go to the debug sidebar `View → Debug`
8. Hit the green arrow beside "Launch Extension" - opens a new window
9. Make a change, and then hit the refresh button on your debug toolbar - this is in your first editor - not the one that popped open.
10. Wait a sec, your changes should now be reflected!
11. Duplicate your changes in the other **variants**
12. Commit your changes to your **fork** of this repo
13. Send a **PR** that contains detailed information about your change
14. I'll review it, and decide whether it should be merged
15. You're done
